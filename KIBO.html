<p class="extraStyle">The Japanese Experiment Module or JEM, also known as Kibo, which means hope in Japanese, is a laboratory. It is produced by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and its basic function is experimentation, although it has a storage and transportation module. Among other things, Kibo has a division with a pressurized area and **an area exposed to outer space for experimentation**. It also has a mechanical arm that allows manipulation of the experiments and objects in the module. Kibo is the largest laboratory module on the ISS, although this is due to the downsizing of the other modules rather than its original size. It was sent to the ISS between 2008 and 2009 in three parts. It currently has the capability to send satellites to the exterior (nanosatellites, weighing less than ten kilos) and its research is focused on biomedical and biophysical aspects related to space.
