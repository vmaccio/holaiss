<p class="aboutStyle">This is a real-time interactive view of the international space station.
    You can access to 3D visualizations of Earth, the space station orbit, 
    and the Station itself. 

    You will enter into an immersive journey through each main module of the 
    station where you will learn what it is used for, when it was assembled 
    and which country was responsible for its manufacture and deployment.
    You will also learn interesting information about the power that keeps 
    it in orbit and its future expansion.
